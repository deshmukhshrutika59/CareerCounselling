        Civil engineers analyze survey reports, maps, and other data to plan projects. They consider construction costs, government regulations, potential environmental hazards, and other factors in planning stages and risk analysis. Engineers use design software to plan and design transportation systems, hydraulic systems, and structures in line with industry and government standards. They perform or oversee, surveying operations to establish reference points, grades, and elevations to guide construction. They also manage the repair, maintenance, and replacement of public and private infrastructure.
